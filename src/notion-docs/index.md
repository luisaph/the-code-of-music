The Code of Music is an interactive handbook that teaches readers how to create musical systems with code, in the browser. Organized in chapters covering the elements of music (rhythm, melody, timbre, harmony, form), the book includes interactive illustrations, editable code examples, a variety of inspiration projects, and step by step tutorials for example projects. These range from audio-visual theremins and probability drum machines to loop-based interactive songs and generative compositions that respond to the current state of the weather. The book is intended for readers who have taken an introductory course on creative computing or have equivalent coding experience. Aiming to welcome the musically-curious and musicians of varying backgrounds, interests, and skill levels, it does not assume previous knowledge of computer music, music theory or production.

The book is currently under development ––this website contains placeholder content of different media types, and functions as a test of the workflow we are developing to publish it in both web and print formats. It is based on lectures and examples from a class of the same name, taught at ITP/IMA, at the graduate and undergraduate levels, in New York City and in Shanghai.
